# Wine Review Sentiment Analysis

I created a statistical algorithm for sentiment-based classification of [wine reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews) based on word counts.

## Features
- an algorithm created from scratch using only Python, Pandas and MatPlotLib
- positive/negative scoring of terms based on their relative frequencies in both sentiment categories
- filtering a subset of terms to only count the most important ones in each review
- achieved ~95% accuracy on test set

## Requirements

This project only requires Python, Pandas and MatPlotLib.
